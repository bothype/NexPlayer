## Documentation
> NexPlayer uses url parameters to get file's url and other customisable settings. So, you will only need to add the correct url parameters and their values in the url.
The below documentation explains all the available parameters and their usage with an example.  
But reading the documention is not important you can simply go to our site and generate the link.
### Video Sources
#### Direct
To stream/play videos from direct sources just add `?v=` and then your video's direct url. Like the below one,  
```
https://bothype.github.io/p/embed.html?v=https://www.w3schools.com/html/mov_bbb.mp4
```  
where `https://bothype.github.io` is the domain of our demo site you can replace it with your own domain and `/p/embed.html` is the directory to the file this is also changeable and `?v=` is the url parameter for the direct video files and`https://www.w3schools.com/html/mov_bbb.mp4` is the direct url to video.
#### Google Drive
